\headline{Projects}

\tabx{c L}
\tbf{Ghost Revenge} & A game for Android. Not a big game, just my first experience in game development
                      and my first release in Google play market. \\[5pt]
\tbf{Blackout}      & An open-source multiplayer 3D game for Android with good physics.
                      Not released yet. I'm currently working on it with a fellow student. \\[5pt]
\tbf{Hwformat}      & Pre-processor for latex which makes it easier for writing small mathematical texts.
                      Mainly for Russian language. Based on regular expressions. \\[5pt]
\tbf{xo\_os}        & An educational project in the university. Small x86-64 OS-kernel written in Rust. \\[5pt]
\end{tabularx}

\headline{Open source experience}

\noindent
I have several merged pull requests to \tbf{Rust}'s standard collections library:

\tabx{l L}
\tbf{BinaryHeap}    & \ttt{append} method (merges two binary heaps in optimal time).
                      It wasn't really hard. Just a first experience. \\[5pt]
\tbf{BTreeMap} and  & \ttt{append} method (merges two BTrees) and \ttt{split\_off} method (splits the tree \\
\tbf{BTreeSet}      & into two at the given key). TODO: quantify your work. \\[5pt]

\headline{Other experience}

\tabx{l L}
\tbf{Programming} & In a high school I was into programming contests and was awarded in many \\
\tbf{contests}    & important russian programming olympiads like "All-Russian Olympiad of School Students in Informatics"
                    and "Open Programming Olympiad". But now I prefer to invest my time in
                    development of my engineering skills. \\[5pt]
\tbf{Teaching}    & I like to teach and I was a teacher for a month in "Summer Informatics School".
                    This is a summer school for children who want to learn more
                    about programming and algorithms than in a common school. \\[5pt]
\tbf{Altai CTF}   & My team was awarded in "Altai CTF" -- an information security competition for univesity students
                    (actually, we was in a high school yet unlike most of our competitors). \\[5pt]

% Also I was awarded in some mathematical olympiads.
